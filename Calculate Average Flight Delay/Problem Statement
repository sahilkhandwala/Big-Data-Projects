Goal - Our	goal	is	to	compute	the	average	delay for	all	two-leg	flights from	airport	ORD (Chicago) to	JFK (New York) where	both	legs	have	a	flight	date	that	falls	into	the	12-month	period	between	June	2007	and	
May	2008 (including	these	two	months). More	precisely:
• A	two-leg	flight	from	ORD	to	JFK consists	of	two	flights	F1	and	F2	with	the	following	properties:
o F1	has	origin	ORD and	some	destination	X that	is	different	from	JFK.
o F2	originates	from	that	airport	X	where	F1	ended;	its	destination	is	JFK.
o F1	and	F2	have	the	same	flight	date.
o The	departure	time	of	F2	is later	than	the	arrival	time	of	F1.	(Use	the	actual	arrival	time	
ArrTime and	the	actual	departure	time	DepTime.)
o Neither	of	the	two	flights	was	cancelled or	diverted
• The	delay of	the	entire	two-leg	flight should	be computed	as	the	delay	of	F1	plus	the	delay	of	F2.	
Use	attribute	ArrDelayMinutes,	which	sets	the	delay	for	early	arrivals	to	zero.
• Compute	a	simple	average	of	the	delays	of	all	flight	pairs	(F1,	F2)	that	match	the	conditions and	
report	it.
