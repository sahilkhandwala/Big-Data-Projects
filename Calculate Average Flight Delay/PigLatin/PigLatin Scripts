Write	three PigLatin	programs.	
JOINFIRST	has	two	different	versions.	It	starts	with	the	join	and	then	
filters	the	results	based	on	the	time-range	constraint,	while	
FILTERFIRST	does	the	filtering	first.

JOINFIRST
1. Load	the	flights	file	as	Flights1.
2. Load	the	flights	file	again	as	Flights2.
3. Remove	as	many	records	and	attributes	from	Flights1	and	Flights2	as	possible,	but	do	NOT yet	
use	the	condition	that	the	flight	date	has	to	be	between	June	2007	and	May	2008.
4. Join	Flights1	and	Flights2,	using	the	condition	that	the	destination	airport	in	Flights1	matches	
the	origin	in	Flights2	and	that	both	have	the	same	flight	date.
5. Filter	out	those	join	tuples	where	the	departure	time	in	Flights2	is	not	after	the	arrival	time	in	
Flights1.
6. Filter	out	those	tuples	whose	flight	date	is	not	between	June	2007	and	May	2008.
a. Version	1:	check	that	both the	flight	date	of	Flights1	and	Flights2	are	in	the	range.
b. Version	2:	only	check	that	the	flight	date	of	Flights1	is	in	the	range.
7. Compute	the	average	delay	over	all	the	tuples	produced	in	the	previous	step.

FILTERFIRST
1. Load	the	flights	file	as	Flights1.
2. Load	the	flights	file	again	as	Flights2.
3. Remove	as	many	records	and	attributes	from	Flights1	and	Flights2	as	possible,	this	time	make	
sure you	also	use	the	condition	that	the	flight	date	has	to	be	between	June	2007	and	May	2008.
4. Join	Flights1	and Flights2,	using	the	condition	that	the	destination	airport	in	Flights1	matches	
the	origin	in	Flights2	and	that	both	have	the	same	flight	date.
5. Filter	out	those	join	tuples	where	the	departure	time	in	Flights2	is	not	after	the	arrival	time	in	
Flights1.
6. Compute	the	average	delay	over	all	the	tuples	produced	in	the	previous	step.
